    <h1>More About Me ðŸš€</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Pratik Patel</strong> â€” a Computer Science student with a heart full of curiosity and a mind
        wired for building. I'm not just learning web development, I'm living it. Every line of code I write is a step
        closer to turning imagination into interactive experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        From crafting clean HTML structures to designing stylish CSS layouts and adding life with JavaScript â€” I find
        joy in the entire creative process. Iâ€™m driven by a passion to build things that not only look good but also
        make peopleâ€™s lives easier and more enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether itâ€™s experimenting with new frameworks, debugging complex logic, or staying up late to finish a project
        that excites me â€” Iâ€™m all in. My goal? To become not just a developer, but a creator who adds value to the
        digital world.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m probably exploring design trends, learning new tech, or dreaming up my next side
        project. I believe that with passion, consistency, and a bit of caffeine â€” anything is possible.
    </p>
    <p><em>Letâ€™s build something awesome together!</em></p>
